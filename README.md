# Personalized E-Commerce Recommender System

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the future of personalized shopping! This project introduces an innovative recommender system that marries **cutting-edge sentiment analysis** and **collaborative filtering techniques** to deliver highly customized product recommendations. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and user feedback, this system redefines how e-commerce platforms understand and cater to individual preferences.

## 🌟 Key Features
1. **Smart Sentiment Analysis** 🧠:
   - Powered by the **BERT model**, this feature analyzes user reviews to capture the emotional undertones and hidden sentiments, making predictions more accurate than ever.
2. **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** ⚙️:
   - A blend of **Collaborative Filtering** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** ensures seamless integration of user-item interactions for precise recommendations.
3. **Unified Approach** 💡:
   - Combines **sentiment scores** with collaborative filtering outputs, creating a powerful synergy that elevates recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction.

## 🔬 Methodology
### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and NaN values to ensure a robust foundation for analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Leveraged a fine-tuned **BERT model** for extracting sentiments from unstructured review data.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Applied **SVD** for generating high-quality recommendations based on user behavior.
4. **Integration**:
   - Synthesized results from sentiment analysis and collaborative filtering to craft personalized suggestions.

## 🎯 Results
- **Baseline Model**:
  - Without preprocessing, the model achieved an accuracy of **91%** and an F1-score of **95%**.
- **Enhanced Model**:
  - With preprocessing and integration, accuracy improved to **95%** and F1-score to **97%**.

This improvement highlights the transformative power of combining sentiment analysis with advanced recommendation techniques.
